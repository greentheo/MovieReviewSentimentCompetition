Awesome!

You've made it this far, which means that you're likely interested in the R code that I've written.

In case you haven't seen it already, the document is live on [my server](http://75.151.93.138:3838/greentheo/MovieReviewSentimentCompetition/CompetitionSummaryAndAnalysis.Rmd).

Then, checkout the Rmd document above in which I used, R, RMarkdown and Shiny to create the live document.

If you're interested please check out my other repositories.  Possibly the best one would be:

[OpenStreetMapR](http://greentheo.github.io/OpenStreetMapR/)
